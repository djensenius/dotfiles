# dotfiles

Modern development environment configuration files optimized for productivity and visual consistency. This setup provides a comprehensive development environment with integrated tools for coding, git workflow, terminal enhancement, and system monitoring.

**Key Features:**
- üé® **Consistent Theming**: [Catppuccin Mocha theme](https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin) across all applications
- üöÄ **Parallel Installation**: 40-60% faster setup with concurrent package installation
- ‚ö° **Performance Optimized**: Fast startup times and efficient resource usage
- üîß **Development Focused**: Comprehensive language support and development tools
- üì¶ **Automated Setup**: One-script installation for GitHub Codespaces
- üêö **Modern Shell**: Fish shell with starship prompt and productivity enhancements

All configurations use the [Catppuccin Mocha theme](https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin) for a consistent and visually appealing look across all tools and applications.

## Installation

### Automated Installation (Recommended)

For GitHub Codespaces, the setup is fully automated with **parallel installation** and **fast track** for essential tools:
```bash
./install.sh                    # Fast track mode: Essential tools ready in ~30s
./install.sh --sequential       # Original sequential mode (10-15 minutes)
./install.sh --help             # See all options
```

**Fast Track Optimization:** Essential tools (tmux + plugins + tmuxinator + nvim) are set up immediately in ~30 seconds, while other development tools install in the background.

**Fast Track Priority (ready in ~20 seconds)**:
- ‚úÖ tmux configuration and plugins (TPM + all plugins installed)
- ‚úÖ tmuxinator for session management  
- ‚úÖ nvim configuration (plugins sync in background)
- ‚úÖ starship prompt, FZF, LazyGit

**Background Installations (non-blocking)**:
- ü¶Ä Rust development tools (bat, rg, fd, eza, zoxide, atuin)
- üì¶ NPM language servers and development tools
- üîå Neovim plugins and Mason language servers  
- üõ†Ô∏è Additional development tools (delta, yq, protobuf, luarocks)

**New Background Installation:** The parallel mode now runs Rust/Cargo tools, NPM packages, and Neovim plugins in the background, allowing you to start using your environment immediately while development tools install in the background.

**Visual Progress Indicator:** When using tmux, a spinning indicator (   ) appears in the status line showing active background installations with the same animation used by lualine in nvim.

**Background Installation Monitoring:**
```bash
# Check installation status
./scripts/check-rust-install.sh      # Rust tools (bat, rg, fd, etc.)
./scripts/check-npm-install.sh       # NPM packages (language servers, etc.)
./scripts/check-neovim-setup.sh      # Neovim plugins and Mason tools

# Monitor installation progress
tail -f ~/.dotfiles_rust_install.log    # Rust tools progress
tail -f ~/.dotfiles_npm_install.log     # NPM packages progress
tail -f ~/.dotfiles_neovim_setup.log    # Neovim setup progress

# Wait for completion (if needed)
wait $(cat ~/.dotfiles_rust_install.pid)  # Wait for Rust tools
wait $(cat ~/.dotfiles_npm_install.pid)   # Wait for NPM packages
wait $(cat ~/.dotfiles_neovim_setup.pid)  # Wait for Neovim setup
```

**Performance:** The new parallel installation reduces foreground setup time by **93%** - from 5+ minutes down to ~20 seconds for immediate productivity!

### Manual Local Installation

For local installation, most configurations can be symlinked to your `~/.config` directory:

1. **Clone this repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/djensenius/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
   cd ~/.dotfiles
   ```

2. **Symlink configurations:**
   ```bash
   # Core shell and editor configs
   ln -sf ~/.dotfiles/fish ~/.config/

   # Development tools
   ln -sf ~/.dotfiles/gitconfig ~/.gitconfig
   ln -sf ~/.dotfiles/gitignore_local ~/.gitignore_local
   ```

3. **Special setup for TMUX:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm ~/.tmux/plugins/tpm
   ~/.tmux/plugins/tpm/scripts/install_plugins.sh
   ```

## Codespaces `install.sh` Script Summary

The `install.sh` script is designed to set up and configure a development environment, particularly for use in GitHub Codespaces. It performs the following tasks:

### 1. Link Configuration Files

- Creates necessary directories and creates symbolic links for various configuration files:
  - `tmux.conf`
  - `gitconfig`
  - `fish`
  - `starship.toml`
  - `nvim`
  - `bat`
  - `vale.ini`
  - `prettierrc.json`
  - `gitmux.conf`
  - `tmuxinator`
  - `neofetch`
  - `atuin`
  - `yazi`
  - `bottom`

- If running within a GitHub Codespace, it links executables (e.g., `rubocop`, `srb`, `bundle`, `solargraph`, `safe-ruby`) to `/usr/local/bin` and updates locale settings.

### 2. Install Software

- Installs various software packages required for the development environment, including:
  - `build-essential`
  - `python3-venv`
  - `socat`
  - `ncat`
  - `ruby-dev`
  - `jq`
  - `pay-respects` (replacement for thefuck)
  - `tmux`
  - `libfuse2`
  - `fuse`
  - `software-properties-common`
  - `most`

- Removes potentially conflicting packages (`bat`, `ripgrep`).

- Installs additional tools via `curl`, `wget`, `cargo`, `go`, `gem`, and `npm`:
  - `starship`
  - `delta`
  - `protobuf`
  - `eza`
  - `zoxide`
  - `ripgrep`
  - `fd-find`
  - `bat`
  - `atuin`
  - `gitmux`
  - `tmuxinator`
  - `neovim-ruby-host`
  - `prettierd`
  - `yaml-language-server`
  - `vscode-langservers-extracted`
  - `eslint_d`
  - `prettier`
  - `tree-sitter`
  - `neovim`
  - `fzf`
  - `lazygit`

### 3. Setup Software

- Logs into `atuin` using provided credentials.
- Installs `tmux` plugins.
- Synchronizes and installs `nvim` plugins.
- If running within a GitHub Codespace
  - Changes the default shell to `fish` for the `vscode` user.
  - Checks the status of the repository.

### 4. Logging

- Logs the progress of file linking, software installation, and software setup to `~/install.log`.
