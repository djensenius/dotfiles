# dotfiles

My config files for various applications to enhance development efficiency and experience. All configurations use the [Catppuccin Mocha theme](https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin) for a consistent and visually appealing look across all tools and applications.

## Local installation

TMUX is a little special and needs this:
```
git clone https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm ~/.tmux/plugins/tpm
~/.tmux/plugins/tpm/scripts/install_plugins.sh
```

Otherwise you *mostly* just symlink to your `~/.config` directory. Take a look at [install.sh](install.sh)
which is used for setting up codespaces if you run into any problems.

## Codespaces `install.sh` Script Summary

The `install.sh` script is designed to set up and configure a development environment, particularly for use in GitHub Codespaces. It performs the following tasks:

### 1. Link Configuration Files

- Creates necessary directories and creates symbolic links for various configuration files:
  - `tmux.conf`
  - `gitconfig`
  - `fish`
  - `starship.toml`
  - `nvim`
  - `bat`
  - `vale.ini`
  - `prettierrc.json`
  - `gitmux.conf`
  - `tmuxinator`
  - `neofetch`
  - `atuin`
  - `yazi`
  - `bottom`

- If running within a GitHub Codespace, it links executables (e.g., `rubocop`, `srb`, `bundle`, `solargraph`, `safe-ruby`) to `/usr/local/bin` and updates locale settings.

### 2. Install Software

- Installs various software packages required for the development environment, including:
  - `build-essential`
  - `python3-venv`
  - `socat`
  - `ncat`
  - `ruby-dev`
  - `jq`
  - `pay-respects` (replacement for thefuck)
  - `tmux`
  - `libfuse2`
  - `fuse`
  - `software-properties-common`
  - `most`

- Removes potentially conflicting packages (`bat`, `ripgrep`).

- Installs additional tools via `curl`, `wget`, `cargo`, `go`, `gem`, and `npm`:
  - `starship`
  - `delta`
  - `protobuf`
  - `eza`
  - `zoxide`
  - `ripgrep`
  - `fd-find`
  - `bat`
  - `atuin`
  - `gitmux`
  - `tmuxinator`
  - `neovim-ruby-host`
  - `prettierd`
  - `yaml-language-server`
  - `vscode-langservers-extracted`
  - `eslint_d`
  - `prettier`
  - `tree-sitter`
  - `neovim`
  - `fzf`
  - `lazygit`

### 3. Setup Software

- Logs into `atuin` using provided credentials.
- Installs `tmux` plugins.
- Synchronizes and installs `nvim` plugins.
- If running within a GitHub Codespace
  - Changes the default shell to `fish` for the `vscode` user.
  - Checks the status of the repository.

### 4. Logging

- Logs the progress of file linking, software installation, and software setup to `~/install.log`.
